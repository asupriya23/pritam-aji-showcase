                        <p>Transfer pricing is the process of setting the price for goods, services, and intellectual property exchanged between related entities within a multinational enterprise. Its primary goal is to fairly allocate profits among these entities based on their respective contributions, functions, and risks.</p>
                        <p>With tax authorities globally intensifying their scrutiny, transfer pricing has become a complex regulatory environment. Organizations need expert benchmarking studies and litigation support to ensure they comply with diverse international laws, a service crucial for subsidiaries of foreign companies and domestic entities alike.</p>

          <p>As per Section 92E of the Income Tax Act, transfer pricing is the price charged in a transaction between related entities within the same Multi-National Enterprise (MNE) group.

          <p>It is mainly used to set prices for goods, services, or intellectual property exchanged between subsidiaries, with the goal of ensuring profits are realized efficiently while remaining compliant with all tax laws.</p>
